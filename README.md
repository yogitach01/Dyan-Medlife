# Problem Statements:-
Now-a-days people face lots of various diseases due to environmental conditions and unhealthy living habits. So the prediction of disease at an earlier stage becomes an important task.
Many a times because of unawareness of people and when it comes to deadly diseases like heart disease,lung cancer,breast cancer.There are multiple factors involved and doctors need s to study lots of reports and there is a chance 
of human error which results in negative result for patient who might be positive and vice versa.If any patient is recognized negative by doctor because of poor analysis.It might be fatal to them because of not detecting it earlier stages.
The correct prediction of diseases become an most challenging task. there are also lot of people who are not financially stable to go to the doctors too. 
There are some common diseases like Malaria,Jaundice etc that shares common symptoms and when we visit doctor he asks us to do lots of lab tests which results in wastage of money as well as unnecessary trauma. we wanted to change this to input the symptoms and it will predict the disease.Also in case of pandemic which we have been recoverd from recently the focus of whole medical system shifts towards the pandemic which leads to ignorance towards other diseases and we lost many people lives for not taking proper treatment or fear of getting tested positive for the disease of the pandemic and not visiting lab for tests.
